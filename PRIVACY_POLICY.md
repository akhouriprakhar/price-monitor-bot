Privacy Policy for Price Tracker Bot (@PriceTrxckBot)
Effective Date: September 1, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Price Tracker Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our service on Telegram.

1. Information We Collect
To provide our price tracking service, we need to collect a limited amount of information:

Telegram User ID: We store your unique, numeric Telegram User ID. This is necessary to associate the products you track with your account and to send you price alert notifications.

Product Information: When you send a product link, we store the URL, the product's title, and its current price in our database. If you set a target price, that is also stored.

We do not collect any other personal information, such as your name, username, or phone number.

2. How We Use Your Information
The information we collect is used exclusively to:

Provide the core functionality of the Bot: tracking prices and sending you alerts.

Respond to your commands (like /list or /start).

Allow you to manage your list of tracked products.

Forward your feedback to the developer if you use the /feedback command.

3. Data Storage and Security
Your data (User ID and tracked products) is stored in a private SQLite database (products.db) hosted on a secure Railway server.

We do not share, sell, or rent your information to any third parties.

4. Data Retention and Deletion
We only store data for products you are actively tracking.

When you use the "Stop Tracking" feature for a product, all information related to that item is permanently deleted from our database.

To delete all of your data from our service, simply remove all products from your tracking list.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in this file.

6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please use the /feedback command within the bot to contact the developer.
